    "Description": "Dota 2 (Defense of the Ancients) is played in matches between two five-player teams, each of which occupies a stronghold in a corner of the playing field. A team wins by destroying the other side's \"Ancient\" building, located within the opposing stronghold. Each player controls one of 111 playable \"Hero\" characters that feature unique powers and styles of play. Each Hero's method of combat is influenced by its primary \"attribute\": Strength, Agility or Intelligence. During a match, the player collects gold, items, and experience points for their Hero, while combating Heroes of the opposite team. Items are objects sold by shops that provide an ability, bonus, or other function not tied to a particular Hero. They come in a multitude of forms and types, and as such can be very different from one item to the next. Items take up space in a Hero's Inventory, meaning only six can be carried at one time.\u000d\u000aThe Dire and Radiant occupy strongholds in opposite corners of the playing field, divided by a river. Within each base is a critical structure called the \"Ancient\", along with a fountain that regenerates Heroes' health and magic points. A match ends when one side breaches the other's stronghold and destroys the Ancient therein. The two strongholds are connected by three paths, referred to as \"lanes\", which are guarded by defensive towers and artificially intelligent creatures called \"creeps\". These creatures periodically spawn in groups and travel along the lanes to attack enemy Heroes, creeps and buildings. Also present are \"neutral creeps\" hostile to both Radiant and Dire, the most powerful of which is \"Roshan\", a boss that may be killed by either side to obtain a powerful reward.\u000d\u000aAll Games\u000d\u000aTeam Size: 5\u000d\u000aMode: Captain's Mode\u000d\u000aMap: Tournament Version\u000d\u000aSpectating: Disabled\u000d\u000aSingle Elimination Bracket\u000d\u000aParticipants & Teams\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aEvery real person - unless officially banned - with a valid steam account is allowed to participate in the competition and will be called \"participant\" in the following.
