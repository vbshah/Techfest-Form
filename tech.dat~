    "Rule": "Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ The rules for a treasure hunt are designed to make it a fair and fun experience for everyone.  Teams are out in a public setting and must really police themselves to ensure that everyone complies with the rules.\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Do not open and view the clues prior to the announcement that the hunt has started.  Soon after the scheduled start time the hunt will begin.  Then and only then should you open your clue packets and view the clues.\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Teams must travel on foot.  With the exception of those who have a physical limitation and require assisted transport to get around (wheelchairs, etc.), teams cannot use cars, trucks, taxis, buses, bicycles or any other motorized or wheeled transport.\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Teams must stay together.  Teams must be at the same clue site at the same time, and you must stay within sight and earshot of each other.  Team members should not use cell phones to communicate, unless youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve become separated for some reason.  Members should not run ahead of the others to solve clues.  If someone gets separated from the team, has to leave early, or to stop for health reasons, that person can rejoin you later, but cannot participate by working on clues while they are away from the rest of the team.\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Teams are free to utilize resources which exist independently of the treasure hunt.  Provided those resources donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t violate any of the other rules, teams are encouraged to use bookstores, libraries, shop vendors, (town historians, if you can find them) to assist with clues.  It improves the overall experience to interact with different people along the way.\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Teams may use smartphones or mobile internet devices.  While we can't keep you from using the internet, we ask that you please use it responsibly (i.e., not as a way to get a final answer to a clue without actually visiting the clue location).  If the above confuses you in any way, here are a couple of guidelines:\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ If anything makes you think, \"Is this cheating?\", it probably is.  Don't do it.\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ If anything makes you think, \"Is this a really clever loophole?\", it's probably cheating.  Don't do it.\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Do not move, tamper with, destroy, or otherwise alter the answers at the clue location.\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Do not guess.  You must visit the clue sites during the hunt in order to correctly answer the question.  It is generally not possible to get the correct answer without physically visited the clue locations.\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Any team found cheating will be disqualified. \r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Event managerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decisions is considered final.\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Event managerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s can change in rules as per the situation.",

Do you think you have the proficiency in analyzing and interpreting codes in minimum possible time? If yes, then this a great opportunity to show off your Speed, Accuracy and Logical abilities in programming, to check your critical thinking in constrained time limit, and to battle with other Geeks out there!\r\nThe event will be similar to a treasure hunt except for the fact that clues/hints here will be in the form of codes in programming languages. From the beginning, each team will be provided a piece of code, which will be a clue to reach the next checkpoint. Teams will have to successfully crack each code to reveal the path to every next checkpoint. All the checkpoints will be present in the VGEC Campus and participants will be provided with a map of the same. For every checkpoint reached, points will be added to the teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s score. If a team is unable to crack a particular code, they can choose to answer an optional theoretical question, which will be related to programming concepts, but will receive lesser points for this. The top 3 teams reaching the final destination will be declared as winners.\r\n\r\nBelow are further details:\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The codes will be provided in C, C++ and Java programming languages, teams can choose any one.\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ There will be a specified time limit, within which each team will have to complete its task.\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ If a team reaches a wrong checkpoint, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be considered a foul and some points will be deducted from the total score.\r\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ The top 3 scoring teams will be considered as the winners and will get exciting prizes!",

Here, all participants have to give test on pen-paper basis and Time-limit of this round is 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nBACKTRACK BLIND CODING: \r\n1 team member would be designing the flowchart of the problem we would be giving but in contrast we will give the executable file or output of the problem so, team member has to use Ã¢â‚¬Å“backtracking processÃ¢â‚¬Â and make the flowchart of it by understanding the output very well and the other person will have to code that program according to the flowchart onto a turned off screen (blind coding). The team with minimum errors and near perfect code will proceed to the next round.\r\nTotal time: 80 minutes \r\n\r\nRELAY CODE: \r\n2 problems would be available to solve of which, difficulty level would be an element of surprise. 1 team member can solve only one code and when optimal solution is achieved by him, other team member will solve other code. Team to finish initially with optimal solutions proceed further.\r\nTotal time: 90 minutes (1.5 hours) (45-45 minutes to each member)\r\n\r\nTHE LOGIC BUSTERS: \r\n3 Problems in time limit of 1.5 hours. Here, both members have to find solution together. Can you solve these puzzles of difficulty level non-immune to many people? Come try us!",

    "Description": "CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t keep your mind of circuits and stuff? Get ready to be ELECTRIFIED as we present to you the most awaited event for all you Tesla fans: Circuitrix.This is a technical event of electronics in which you can showcase your potential to be a circuit master. Let the mastermind inside you bring out your designing and implementing capabilities. Showcase your wisdom in circuits and get rewarded!\r\nThe event will have 3 rounds to test your designing skills.\r\n\r\nRound 1:\r\nThis round is a MCQ based round. Questions related to mathematics, logic and basic electronics will be asked. Selected teams will proceed to the next round.\r\n\r\nRound 2:\r\nThis round is completely based on Matlab and Multisim. Simple circuits and some problems related to circuits will be asked. The teams will have to get the required output on the software. Marks will be given according to the overall performance of the team members. The selected teams will then move on to the finals.\r\n\r\nRound 3:\r\nThe final round is all about designing a practical hardware circuit based on the given problem statement. Here all the teams will compete against each other as it will be a race against time. The accuracy and approach in the circuit will be tested and 3 prizes will be given at the completion.\r\n\r\nJUDGING CRITERIA\r\n\r\nRound 1: This round is based on MCQs. For every correct answer 1 mark will be given and for every incorrect answer 0.25 marks will be deducted. A merit list will be prepared listing the marks scored by each team. The top 12 teams with the highest marks will then move on to the next round.\r\n\r\nRound 2: In this round, the teams are required to get the output of the problem on the software skillfully and quickly. The teams will be rated according to the time taken to get the required output and the design used in solving the problem. In case the output is not obtained, decision will be taken on the basis of how the problem has been attempted to solve. The top 5 teams will move on to the next round.\r\n\r\nRound 3: In the final round, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a race against time. Hence the teams who finish the circuit designing and obtain the required output skillfully and in the least amount of time will be declared winners. Marking will be done as per the performance of the teams.\r\n  \r\nThe final decision for elimination will be in the hands of Event Managers/ Coordinators",
