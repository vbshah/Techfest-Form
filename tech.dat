    "Description": "Earthquake-resistant structures are those structures that are designed to withstand earthquakes. While no structure can be entirely immune to damage from earthquakes, the goal of earthquake resistant structure is to erect the structures that fare better during seismic activity. Earthquake-resistant structures are intended to withstand the largest earthquake of a certain probability that is likely to occur at their location. This means the loss of life should be minimized by preventing collapse of the buildings for rare earthquakes while the loss of functionality should be limited for more frequent ones.\r\nYou have to make model with the dimensions (like base, height, etc) from the material that would be provided by us. Your model is tested by shaking of table (we will prepare that for you). Your model should sustain the earthquake load. This is to check the stability of high rise building with earthquake load. You are given certain time (we will tell you on the spot, like 2hrs or so) to prepare the model.\r\n\r\nJudging criteria:\r\nThe model will be judged on the basis of their stability to earthquake load provided from shake table.",

Team to finish initially with optimal solutions proceed further.\r\nTotal time: 90 minutes (1.5 hours) (45-45 minutes to each member)\r\n\r\nTHE LOGIC BUSTERS: \r\n3 Problems in time limit of 1.5 hours. Here, both members have to find solution together. Can you solve these puzzles of difficulty level non-immune to many people? Come try us!",

Get ready to be ELECTRIFIED as we present to you the most awaited event for all you Tesla fans: Circuitrix.This is a technical event of electronics in which you can showcase your potential to be a circuit master. Let the mastermind inside you bring out your designing and implementing capabilities. Showcase your wisdom in circuits and get rewarded!\r\nThe event will have 3 rounds to test your designing skills.\r\n\r\nRound 1:\r\nThis round is a MCQ based round. Questions related to mathematics, logic and basic electronics will be asked. Selected teams will proceed to the next round.\r\n\r\nRound 2:\r\nThis round is completely based on Matlab and Multisim. Simple circuits and some problems related to circuits will be asked. The teams will have to get the required output on the software. Marks will be given according to the overall performance of the team members. The selected teams will then move on to the finals.\r\n\r\nRound 3:\r\nThe final round is all about designing a practical hardware circuit based on the given problem statement. Here all the teams will compete against each other as it will be a race against time. The accuracy and approach in the circuit will be tested and 3 prizes will be given at the completion.\r\n\r\nJUDGING CRITERIA\r\n\r\nRound 1: This round is based on MCQs. For every correct answer 1 mark will be given and for every incorrect answer 0.25 marks will be deducted. A merit list will be prepared listing the marks scored by each team. The top 12 teams with the highest marks will then move on to the next round.\r\n\r\nRound 2: In this round, the teams are required to get the output of the problem on the software skillfully and quickly. The teams will be rated according to the time taken to get the required output and the design used in solving the problem. In case the output is not obtained, decision will be taken on the basis of how the problem has been attempted to solve. The top 5 teams will move on to the next round.\r\n\r\nRound 3: In the final round, itÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…Â¾Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢s a race against time. Hence the teams who finish the circuit designing and obtain the required output skillfully and in the least amount of time will be declared winners. Marking will be done as per the performance of the teams.\r\n  \r\nThe final decision for elimination will be in the hands of Event Managers/ Coordinators",
