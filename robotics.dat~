Each game has different scoring system.\u000d\u000a• In the first section of game, both the participants play soccer. There will be three balls, and each has different points. The second section of the game is the combination of bowling, dropping and pushing. In this section time is counted.\u000d\u000a• In the bowling, both participants try to knock down pins by pushing balls. Points will  be given on basis of number of knocked pins. After this, both the participants get entry in the dropping. Here, just push the ball and try to drop in to the hole. In the last part of game, participants try to push object at given common place.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aROUND 1: \u000d\u000a• This round is elimination round and the participants will have to compete each others. The winner will qualify for the second round based on the number of points (includes time duration.)\u000d\u000aTop 8 robots will be selected for second round. \u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aROUND 2: \u000d\u000a• Here is a small change in pushing part of the game! One spelling is given to both the participants and they try to push objects and put it on each letter of the spelling (on alphabet sheet).\u000d\u000aTop 4 robots will be selected for third round.\u000d\u000a\u000d\u000aROUND 3: \u000d\u000a• In this round participants will not play soccer; they will push the ball and try to pass through ring .
